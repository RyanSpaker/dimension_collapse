I am going with a top down shooter. I believe that building a boss rush game is definitely going to showcase my best talents, and wont have any major hurdles to overcome in the 2 weeks

Art stlye:
Simple, the characters are made up of simple shapes. That being said I dont think I will go with pixel art, just simple vector graphics.
Animation will be done procedurally when possible. For this reason, I will be using unity since I dont know how I would do this well in Bevy.
