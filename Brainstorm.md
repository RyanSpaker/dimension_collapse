Theme: Aberration

Ideas:

Chromatic Aberration: Just becuase acerola said not to.
This is where the channels of light seperate by some offset due to a deffective lens


Aberration is the deviation of the expected in an unwelcome way.
Ghosts and monsters are often called aberrations

Initial Idea:
You fight as god, albeit one with no power. You gave up your power when you created the world and all that reside in it.
You regret your actions now though, as the world you built is rife with corruption and ilk. You now fight to destroy the world you built, and regain the power you lost.
You probably should have some motivation like the residents of the world trying to kill you or something.

It would probably be a platformer roguelite, storydriven, and small. The downsides would be a large amount of art needing to be created, and thus a poor quality due to skill limitations.

There would be powerups you gain as you progress through the game, regaining the power of a god. Grapple hook , big plus.

I could also include chromatic aberration as a damage effect. Splitting into 3 seperate entities of red blue and green could also be a cool idea.


Horror:
I don't want to make a horror game. I'm not really that good at it, and I already have the corn game, so I think I'll steer clear of this.


Aberration: Strange, rare occurence

 
planets aligning

hallucination

detective game about finding an elusive murderer

assassin game

Inspiration from house of leaves? Unseen monster



Idea 2:

One day while out with a friend you get seperated in a dark and scary place. You fight to escape all while being hunted by an unseen foe.
As you progress through the game you encounter monsters of your mind that you must defeat. At the end of the game you finally come face to face with the unseen monster.
Its sleeping, and you, in a terror, stab it. But it was also a figment of your mind, and what was actually sleeping was your lost friend.

Cons: Its a horror game, its kinda cliche, requires a lot of story and art, gameplay would be hit or miss.

Idea 3:
You fight to keep the world in check, as time moves on the world goes out of control. Chromatic aberration and temporal aberration are causing things to become fragmented and broken. As you fight, the world become better.
Risk of rain like difficulty progrression, as you do poorly, the world breaks and becomes more difficult to navigate.
