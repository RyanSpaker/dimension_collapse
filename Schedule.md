15 day plan:

Wed Feb 28th:
Jam starts, find out theme and start brainstorming.
Generate at least 5 ideas for a game, as well as some pros and cons of going for each idea.

Thr Feb 29th:
Settle on a game idea.
Decide whether to write in unity or bevy.
Start fleshing out game play and features
Decide exactly what is important to me and what isn't as important.
Setup a initial project

Fri March 1st:
Start to skeleton the game, try and get some basic features up and running. Will be busy that day, but try to get as much done as possible

Sat/Sun: 
Grind. Get features implemented, decide which features aren't good enough, decide which are infeasible. 
Do Not Get Stuck Trying To Implement A Single Feature For An Entire Day!
By the end of sunday I want a simple lose and win condition at least.

Mon March 4th - Fri March 8th:
Get the game to look like a game. I want menu's, Graphics, Art, Post-Processing.
By the end of the week it should feel like a game, a shitty game, but a game none the less.

Saturday - Tuesday March 12th:
I'll be on break with no work to do so this will be my time to shine.
I'll make the game fun, fix parts that dont work, add more parts to make it better.
Improve quality, fix bugs, make it something I can be proud of.


Wed March 13th:
Finishing touches + small QOL features.
